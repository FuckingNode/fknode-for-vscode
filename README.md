# FuckingNode for Visual Studio Code

An extension that brings [FuckingNode's features](https://github.com/FuckingNode/FuckingNode) to VSCode's Command Palette and autocompletion for `fknode.yaml`, allowing you to quickly configure a project, or run the clean task on the currently open project without even touching the terminal.

Requires FuckingNode to be installed.
